-- Write a query to generate Table 1 in the sr28_doc.pdf (you donâ€™t need to sort it in exactly the same way as Table 1).
-- Nutr. No | Nutrient | Count

SELECT N.Nutr_No as "Nutr. No", ND.NutrDesc AS "Nutrient" , count(N.Nutr_No) as "Count"
-- SELECT N.Nutr_No as "Nutr. No", ND.NutrDesc AS "Nutrient" , count(F.NDB_No) as "Count"
FROM NUT_DATA N, FOOD_DES F,  NUTR_DEF ND
WHERE ND.Nutr_No = N.Nutr_No
    AND F.NDB_No = N.NDB_No
GROUP BY N.Nutr_No;



-- By the query
--  SELECT count(NDB_No)
--      from FOOD_DES;
-- the total number of food is 7797, different from Table 1
